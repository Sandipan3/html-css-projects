            <p class="rp1">Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose</p>
            <p class="rp2">Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, often referred to as "Netaji," was a
                prominent Indian
                nationalist
                leader
                who played a crucial role in the country's struggle for independence from British
                rule. Born on
                January
                23,
                1897, Bose's fierce patriotism and determination made him a significant figure in
                India's fight
                against
                colonialism. He became a key member of the Indian National Congress but later parted
                ways due to
                ideological
                differences, advocating for more aggressive methods to achieve independence. Bose's
                famous slogan
                "Give
                me
                blood, and I shall give you freedom" encapsulated his fervent commitment to
                liberating India. He
                established
                the Forward Bloc and formed alliances with Axis powers during World War II to gain
                support for
                India's
                cause. His mysterious disappearance in 1945 remains a subject of speculation and
                intrigue, with
                various
                theories surrounding his fate. Despite the controversies surrounding his methods and
                disappearance,
                Bose
                remains a revered figure in Indian history, celebrated for his unwavering dedication
                to the nation's
                freedom
                struggle and his vision of a strong, independent India.</p>
